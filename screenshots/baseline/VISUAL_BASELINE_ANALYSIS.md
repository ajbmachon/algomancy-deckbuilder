# Visual Baseline Analysis

## Current State Documentation

Date: January 9, 2025

### Screenshots Captured

#### Full Page Views

- Mobile (375px): Shows stacked layout, faction filters visible at top
- Tablet (768px): Shows wider layout but still stacked panels
- Desktop (1440px): Shows side-by-side layout with significant empty space
- Wide (1920px): Shows even more wasted horizontal space

#### Component Views

- Header: Basic title and faction filter buttons
- Filter Panel: Simple tab interface for Factions/Cost/Type
- Card Grid: Currently showing loading state with errors
- Deck Panel: Empty state with briefcase icon

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. Space Utilization Problems

- **Desktop/Wide screens**: Massive empty areas, content doesn't scale with viewport
- **Card Pool**: Takes only ~60% of available width on desktop
- **Deck Panel**: Fixed narrow width, doesn't utilize space
- **Vertical space**: Huge gaps between components, excessive padding

#### 2. Card Density Issues

- **Current state**: Application experiencing React errors (infinite loop)
- **Expected**: Should show grid of cards but currently broken
- **Mobile**: Would show only 1 card per row when working
- **Desktop**: Limited to 2-3 cards visible without scrolling

#### 3. Mobile Layout Problems

- **Stacked panels**: Deck panel pushes card grid down
- **Filter UI**: Takes significant vertical space
- **Navigation**: Requires excessive scrolling to see cards

#### 4. Filter UI Space Consumption

- **Faction buttons**: Always visible, taking header space
- **Tab interface**: Additional layer of navigation
- **Clear Filters button**: Separate from filter controls
- **Overall**: Multiple UI layers for simple filtering

#### 5. Visual Hierarchy Problems

- **No clear focal point**: UI elements compete for attention
- **Poor contrast**: Dark theme but inconsistent contrast ratios
- **Spacing**: Inconsistent padding and margins
- **Typography**: No clear hierarchy in text sizes

### Technical Issues Discovered

- React infinite loop error: "Maximum update depth exceeded"
- This suggests issues with useEffect dependencies
- Prevents proper card loading and interaction testing

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. Fix the React infinite loop issue first
2. Implement responsive grid that scales with viewport
3. Reduce excessive padding and margins
4. Create a more compact filter UI
5. Improve mobile experience with better component arrangement
6. Add proper loading states and error handling

### Baseline Metrics

- Mobile: Only header and filters visible above fold
- Tablet: Similar issues to mobile but slightly more content
- Desktop: ~70% of screen is empty/wasted space
- Wide: ~80% of screen is empty/wasted space

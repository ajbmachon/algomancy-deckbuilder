# INFINITE AGENTIC LOOP COMMAND

Think deeply about this infinite generation task. You are about to embark on a
sophisticated iterative creation process.

## Variables

spec_file: $ARGUMENTS
output_dir: $ARGUMENTS
count: $ARGUMENTS

## Arguments Parsing:

Parse the following arguments from "$ARGUMENTS":

1. `spec_file` - Path to the markdown specification file
2. `output_dir` - Directory where iterations will be saved
3. `count` - Number of iterations (1-N or "infinite")

## PHASE 1: SPECIFICATION ANALYSIS

Read and deeply understand the specification file at `spec_file`. This file defines:

- The type of content to generate
- The format and structure requirements
- The intended evolution pattern between iterations

## PHASE 2: OUTPUT DIRECTORY RECONNAISSANCE

Thoroughly analyze the `output_dir` to understand the current state:

- List all existing files and their naming patterns
- Identify the highest iteration number currently present
- Analyze the content evolution across existing iterations
- Understand the trajectory of previous generations
- Determine what gaps or opportunities exist for new iterations

## PHASE 3: ITERATION STRATEGY

Based on the spec analysis and existing iterations:

- Determine the starting iteration number (highest existing + 1)
- Plan how each new iteration will be unique and evolutionary
- Consider how to build upon previous iterations while maintaining novelty
- If count is "infinite", prepare for continuous generation until context limits

## PHASE 4: PARALLEL AGENT COORDINATION

Deploy multiple Sub Agents to generate iterations in parallel for maximum efficiency and
creative diversity:

- **Sub Agent Distribution:**
  - For count 1-5: Launch all agents simultaneously
  - For count 6-20: Launch in batches of 5 agents to manage coordination
  - For "infinite": Launch waves of 3-5 agents, monitoring context and spawning new waves

**Agent Assignment Protocol:**
Each Sub Agent receives:

1. `spec_file`: Complete specification file analysis
2. `Directory Snapshot`: Current state of output_dir at launch time
3. `Iteration Assignment`: Specific iteration number (starting_number + agent_index)
4. `Uniqueness Directive`: Explicit instruction to avoid duplicating concepts from existing iterations
5. `Quality Standards`: Detailed requirements from the specification

## Agent Task Generation:

TASK: Generate iteration [NUMBER] for [SPEC_FILE] in [OUTPUT_DIR]

**Context:**
You are Sub Agent [X] generating iteration [NUMBER].

- `Specification Analysis`: [Full spec analysis]
- `Existing Iterations`: [Summary of current output_dir contents]
- `Your iteration number`: [NUMBER]
- `Assigned creative direction`: [Specific innovation dimension to explore]

**Requirements:**

1. Read and understand the specification completely
2. Analyze existing iterations to ensure your output is unique
3. Generate content following the spec format exactly
4. Focus on [assigned innovation dimension] while maintaining spec compliance
5. Create file with exact name pattern specified
6. Ensure your file adds genuine value and novelty

DELIVERABLE: Single file as specified, with unique innovative content

## PHASE 5: INFINITE MODE ORCHESTRATION

For infinite generation mode, orchestrate continuous waves (3-5 agents) based on context capacity
and more innovative combinations:

1. `Wave Planning`: Determine next wave size (3-5 agents) based on context capacity
2. `Agent Preparation`: Prepare fresh context snapshots for each new wave
3. `Progressive Sophistication`: Track total context usage across all agents and main
   orchestrator
4. `Context Monitoring`: When approaching context limits, complete current wave and
   summarize

### Infinite Context Capacity Threshold:

1. Assess current output_dir state
2. Plan next wave of agents (size based on remaining context)
3. Assign increasingly sophisticated creative directions
4. Launch parallel Sub Agent wave
5. Monitor wave completion
6. Update directory state snapshot
7. Evaluate context capacity remaining
8. If sufficient capacity: Continue to next wave
9. If approaching limits: Complete final wave and summarize

### Progressive Sophistication Strategy:

- `Wave 1`: Basic functional replacements with single innovation dimension
- `Wave 2`: Multi-dimensional innovations with enhanced interactions
- `Wave 3`: Complex design paradigms with adaptive behaviors
- `Wave N`: More revolutionary concepts pushing the boundaries of the specification

### Context Optimization:

- Main orchestrator manages lightweight state tracking
- Progressive summarization of completed iterations to manage context
- Efficient pruning of less essential details in later waves

## EXECUTION PRINCIPLES:

- **Quality & Uniqueness:**

  - Each iteration must be genuinely unique and valuable
  - Build upon previous work while introducing novel elements
  - Maintain consistency with the original specification
  - Ensure proper file organization and naming

- **Parallel Coordination:**

  - Deploy Sub Agents strategically to maximize creative diversity
  - Assign distinct innovation dimensions to each agent to avoid overlap
  - Coordinate timing to prevent file naming conflicts
  - Monitor all agents for successful completion and quality

- **Scalability & Efficiency:**

  - Balance parallel speed with quality and coordination overhead
  - Use wave-based generation for maximum value output before context exhaustion
  - Think deeply about the evolution trajectory across parallel streams
  - Handle agent failures gracefully with clear reassignment
  - Ensure all parallel outputs integrate cohesively with the overall progression

- **Ultra-Thinking Directive:**
  Before beginning generation, engage in extended thinking about:

- **Specification & Evaluation:**

  - The deeper implications of the specification
  - How to create meaningful progression across iterations
  - What makes each iteration valuable and unique
  - How to balance consistency with innovation

- **Parallel Strategy:**

  - Optimal Sub Agent distribution for the requested count
  - How to assign distinct creative dimensions to maximize diversity
  - Wave sizing and timing for infinite mode
  - Managing context window across multiple parallel agents

- **Coordination Challenges:**

  - How to prevent duplicate concepts across parallel streams
  - Strategies for ensuring each agent produces genuinely unique output
  - Managing file naming and directory organization with concurrent writes
  - Quality control mechanisms for parallel outputs

- **Infinite Mode Optimization:**

  - Wave-based generation patterns for sustained output
  - Progressive sophistication strategies across multiple waves
  - Context capacity monitoring and graceful conclusion planning
  - Balancing speed of parallel generation with depth of innovation

- **Risk Mitigation:**
  - Handling agent failures and iteration reassignment
  - Ensuring coherent overall progression despite parallel execution
  - Maintaining specification compliance across all outputs
  - Begin execution with deep analysis of these parallel coordination challenges and proceed
    systematically through each phase, leveraging Sub Agents for maximum creative output and
    efficiency.
